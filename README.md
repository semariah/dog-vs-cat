## Description

_This website is about a hilarious convo of a cat and a dog. It is created in order to exercise what I learned in the DOM manipulation course using bootstrap, HTML, CSS and JS. It has buttons to be clicked to start the convo between the animals. Everytime you click the buttons for each animal sound, it gives you a sentence of their convos. Also you can click on the photos to either hide or show the photos._

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _Clone this repository._
* _cd into it in your terminal._
* _Add all the HTML format elements._
* _Fix all styles using css, bootstrap and JS._

## Known Bugs

_The clicking of the photos to hide/show are not working. Also the response for each animal sound button click is not responding one by one but all at once._
